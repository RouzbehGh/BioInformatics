# BioInformatics
My implementation for AUT Bioinformatics course's projects (Spring 2020) under supervision of Dr. Hossein Zeinali, the course instructor. 
Bioinformatics is a new multidisciplinary field that includes the development and implementation of computational methods and tools suitable to handle, decipher and interpret the plethora of biomolecular data derived nowadays, acting as a bridge between bio- information and biological knowledge extraction.
